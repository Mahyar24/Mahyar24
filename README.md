## About Me

I am an experienced **quantitative data scientist** with **seven years of industry expertise** in machine learning, time-series analysis, and financial modeling. My professional focus lies at the intersection of:

- Predictive modeling and Transformers
- Natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs)
- Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in finance
- Interpretable AI
- Time-series analysis for financial and algorithmic insights
- Building AI-driven trading strategies and financial systems

I am currently seeking opportunities to begin a **Ph.D. in Fall 2025**. My aim is to contribute to groundbreaking advancements in machine learning, interpretable AI, and finance by blending rigorous research with practical applications.
